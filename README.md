***Introduction***  
The Smart Railway Navigation System is a technology-driven solution designed to assist passengers 
in navigating large and complex railway stations with ease, independence, and confidence. The system 
is developed to enhance accessibility, reduce confusion, and minimize dependence on manual assistance 
or static signage, especially for first-time travelers, elderly individuals, and persons with disabilities. <br>
The project integrates intelligent features such as real-time pathfinding using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, voice- 
assisted navigation via text-to-speech, chatbot support for user queries, and a responsive, browser-based 
interface. It is built using modern technologies including React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, 
and React Leaflet, making it fast, scalable, and cross-platform compatible without requiring mobile app 
installation.

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
The Smart Railway Navigation System project was initiated to address a persistent and widespread challenge 
faced by commuters: navigating large and often complex railway stations, particularly in a country like India 
where railway travel is a primary mode of transportation for millions. Despite technological advances in 
booking systems and train services, many stations still lack adequate wayfinding solutions. This creates 
difficulties for all users, especially first-time travelers, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. The 
project effectively addresses these concerns by offering a modern, inclusive, and user-friendly digital 
solution.

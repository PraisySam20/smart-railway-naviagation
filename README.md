# smart-railway-naviagation
##Introduction
The Smart Railway Navigation System is a technology-driven solution designed to assist passengers 
in navigating large and complex railway stations with ease, independence, and confidence. The system 
is developed to enhance accessibility, reduce confusion, and minimize dependence on manual assistance 
or static signage, especially for first-time travelers, elderly individuals, and persons with disabilities. 
The project integrates intelligent features such as real-time pathfinding using Dijkstra’s algorithm, voice- 
assisted navigation via text-to-speech, chatbot support for user queries, and a responsive, browser-based 
interface. It is built using modern technologies including React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, 
and React Leaflet, making it fast, scalable, and cross-platform compatible without requiring mobile app 
installation.  

##Objectives 
-To develop a fully browser-based navigation platform that requires no app installation and works 
across all modern devices. 
-To implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for computing the shortest and most accessible path between key 
station facilities. 
-To integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology for real-time voice guidance, especially for visually 
impaired users. 
-To create an interactive map interface for railway stations using React Leaflet and station layout data. 
-To build a chatbot assistant capable of answering frequently asked questions related to station 
services and navigation. 
-To design a modular and scalable system that can be extended to other environments like airports, 
malls, and campuses. 
-To ensure user data security with JWT-based authentication and password encryption using bcryptjs. 
-To maintain high accessibility standards through responsive UI, icon-based markers, and a minimalist 
design.

# smart-railway-naviagation
The Smart Railway Navigation System is a technology-driven solution designed to assist passengers 
in navigating large and complex railway stations with ease, independence, and confidence. The system 
is developed to enhance accessibility, reduce confusion, and minimize dependence on manual assistance 
or static signage, especially for first-time travelers, elderly individuals, and persons with disabilities. 
• The project integrates intelligent features such as real-time pathfinding using Dijkstra’s algorithm, voice- 
assisted navigation via text-to-speech, chatbot support for user queries, and a responsive, browser-based 
interface. It is built using modern technologies including React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, 
and React Leaflet, making it fast, scalable, and cross-platform compatible without requiring mobile app 
installation.
